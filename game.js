// This is a basic outline for a platformer game in JavaScript.

// First, we need to set up our game environment. This will include the game canvas and the game loop.

// The canvas is the area where our game will be displayed. We'll create it using the HTML5 canvas API.
var canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
document.body.appendChild(canvas);
canvas.width = 800;
canvas.height = 600;

// The context is what we'll use to draw on the canvas.
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

// The game loop is a function that updates the game state and redraws the screen.
// We'll use requestAnimationFrame to call it as fast as the browser can handle (usually 60 times per second).
function gameLoop() {
  // Update game state
  
  // Redraw screen
  
  // Call the next game loop
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

// Start the game loop
requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);

// Now we need to create our player. The player will be an object with properties for its position and velocity.
var player = {
  x: 0,
  y: 0,
  vx: 0,
  vy: 0
};

// We'll also need to handle input. We'll create an object to hold the current state of each key.
var keys = {};
window.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
  keys[e.key] = true;
});
window.addEventListener('keyup', function(e) {
  keys[e.key] = false;
});

// In our game loop, we'll update the player's velocity based on which keys are pressed.
// Then we'll update the player's position based on its velocity.

// We'll also need to implement collision detection. This will involve checking if the player is colliding with any platforms or enemies, and responding appropriately.

// Finally, we'll need to draw everything to the screen. This will involve clearing the canvas, then drawing the player and any platforms or enemies.

// This is just a basic outline. There are many more details you'll need to fill in as you go. Good luck!
